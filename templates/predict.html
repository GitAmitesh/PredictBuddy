                     <span style="font-size: 2.5rem; font-weight: bold; color: #66d9ef;">PLACED!!</span><br>
                     Looks like youâ€™re all set to conquer the world! ðŸŒŸ Your placement prediction is looking bright and shiny. Get ready to pop the confetti and celebrate because your hard work is about to pay off! ðŸ¥³âœ¨ <br>
                     Time to step into the spotlight and show everyone what youâ€™re made of. The future is yoursâ€”go out there and rock it! ðŸš€ðŸ’¼

                    <span style="font-size: 1.4rem; font-weight: bold;">Our PredictBuddy has predicted you will not be placed.</span><br><br>
                    Looks like the placement gods arenâ€™t smiling today! ðŸ˜… But donâ€™t worry, this is just a minor setback. Dust off your resume, power up your confidence, and get ready to impress the next opportunity that comes your way. <br>
                    ðŸŒŸ Remember, every great success story has its ups and downsâ€”yours is just getting started! Keep pushing forward, and the future will be bright! ðŸŒˆ
